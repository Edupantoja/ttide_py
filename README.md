ttide_py
========

A direct conversion of T_Tide to Python.



This is a work in progress. 
It is not done or functional.
Any help with the conversion is welcome.

All credit for package goes to Rich Pawlowicz, he wrote T_Tide for Matlab. 
It is available at http://www2.ocgy.ubc.ca/~rich/.
This work is just a programming language conversion.
